## General info
When I finished the ES6 courses I decided to write something bigger than next "Hello world" to check myself and consolidate my knowledge. The effect of this is the following library which is my first useful (I hope so) project. Feel free to use or edit the code and if you have any suggestions or ideas to improve the slider share them with me, please.

## Technologies
* Java Script (ECMAScript 2015 standard);
* Special thanks for Webpack and Babel developers for the necessary tools to bundle and transpile my code to minifed version;

## Setup
To setup ez.Slider you have to embed the library code and pass valid DOM structure to it by marking it as "ezSliderTarget" class. You can also use it by global object ezSlider. For more information about setup ez.Slider and examples check out the [documentaton](https://mateuszgdula.github.io/ezslider/).

## Status
The project is in progress, the next versions will be extended by more styles of slider animation.
